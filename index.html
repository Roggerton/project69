                <p>Review: The movie was good, it was about a villain who adopts 3 children to get the money to steal the moon. He ends up treating and loving the daughters like his own children, and while he was about to go to their ballet recital, he goes on and steals the moon. He wants to go back to the daughters to see their recital to show them that he loves them, (since before he has left them), but they get kidnapped, the villain saved them, and that is the end.</p>

                <p>Review: The movie was good, it showed the beginning of a war that were in 9 movies, and it showed how Anakin began as a jedi, and it showed how Anakin and Padme met. But the reason I rate it 4 stars is because the movie can get boring at times, but other than that, I really like the movie.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">At least 46 people have died due to severe flooding in western Europe, caused by what experts described as the heaviest rainfall in a century.

                    Up to 70 people are missing in Germany after flash floods swept across western and southern parts of the country, causing buildings to collapse, police said Thursday. Germany is worst hit with 40 people killed, while six people died in Belgium. Luxembourg and the Netherlands are also affected.
                    "In some areas we have not seen this much rainfall in 100 years," Andreas Friedrich, a German weather service (DWD) spokesman, told CNN. He added that "in some areas we've seen more than double the amount of rainfall which has caused flooding and unfortunately some building structures to collapse."</p>

                <h4>The hot Miami condo market is a lot more complicated after tragic Surfside collapse</h4>
                <img class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12" src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106911357-1626353107467-gettyimages-1305077077-1006_03_fl210215d04.jpeg?v=1626353199&w=740&h=416">
                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The tragic collapse of a residential tower spooked South Florida homebuyers and real estate investors alike into reassessing the risk of buying in the Miami-area condo market.

                    The market had been booming before Covid. Then it soared even higher as the work-from-anywhere culture took hold. But then in late June, scores of people were crushed to death in the Champlain Towers South collapse in Surfside.

                    Now, the market is focused on engineering inspection reports from older towers, which are required by the state to get recertified every 40 years. Insurers are also under scrutiny, as they hold the keys to new purchases in the market.

                    “No one in their right mind is going to buy a condo built before 2000 unless they have a safety certificate for the structure of the building, and it doesn’t exist today,” said Peter Zalewski, a South Florida condominium expert, consultant and analyst.

                    The Miami area has long been a tale of two condominium markets: those built before and after the year 2000, when strict new building codes born of damage from Hurricane Andrew went into effect. Now, after the tower disaster, the divide is suddenly even wider.

                    “Zoning was upgraded to the point where Miami Dade County zoning is probably some of the toughest in the state or the country, and as a result of that we were able to build again,” said Zalewski. “The thing is people weren’t aware of it prior to Champlain. Now, everybody knows about it, so there’ll be a great divide.”

                    While condo boards are rushing to send letters of assurance to owners, Zalewski said potential buyers cannot see inspection reports.

                    “No condo I’ve ever seen, and I’ve been here since 1993, has ever openly shared that information. There is a lack of transparency in the condo market here, by design, it is a sell-side market,” he said. “The condo association might put out the information right now. How did they find these engineers and why haven’t they shared them previously?”</p>
